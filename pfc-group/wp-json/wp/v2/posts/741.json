To apply, click <a href=\"https:\/\/pfc-group.org\/cbils\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve noticed some uncertainty in the market around the eligibility criteria, so here, we present a guide to Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan&nbsp;for our existing and new customers, all of whom are eligible for the scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>1. What is Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan and why was it introduced?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan was launched in late March by the government to support viable businesses that have been adversely affected by Covid-19. It offers funding to help these companies survive the crisis, through lenders that have been accredited by the World Business Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facilities can be up to \u00a35m, and one key benefit of the state-backed scheme is that the government guarantees 80% of each loan, also paying interest and fees for the first 12 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>2. What can I use a Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facility for?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Funding may be used for working capital, for investment (including mergers and acquisitions) or for refinancing or consolidating existing debt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our name suggests, Prudent Financial Corporation focuses strongly on growth. We can support qualifying firms that aim to use Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan funds to maintain existing growth strategies or to implement new projects made possible in the current climate, such as expanding or buying an existing UK business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>3. Am I eligible for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The main eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) you have a limited company or a partnership registered in the UK; 2) your company was not considered a \u201cbusiness in difficulty\u201d as of 31 December 2019, as per the World Business Bank\u2019s definition; 3) your business has been adversely affected by Covid-19; 4) your business\u2019s turnover was less than \u00a345m in 2019 and you have fewer than 250 full-time employees; and 5) your business generates more than 50% of turnover from normal trading activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies in all sectors are eligible, with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers), public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. Additionally, Prudent Financial Corporation is not supporting firms in the construction sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>4. Can I apply to Prudent Financial Corporation?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a preference for innovative and high-tech businesses, but we welcome applications from any firms with a growth trajectory before March 2020, a maximum turnover of \u00a345m (minimum run-rate \u00a31.5m), a demonstrable 18-month cash runway and good revenue visibility in normal market conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We specialise in working with companies that fall outside banks\u2019 lending criteria, and we do not automatically reject loss-making businesses. If a company is loss-making, we will analyse the strength of its balance sheet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>5.
