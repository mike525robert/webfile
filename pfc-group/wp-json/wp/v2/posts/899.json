The funding market can be difficult to navigate in normal circumstances, but with a global health crisis resulting in a raft of new government schemes (with differing criteria from lenders), it is little wonder that the business community has been left confused about its options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to this a heady mix of anxiety and increased stress levels, induced by the possibility of job losses amid a severely affected economy, and snap decisions are to be expected from business owners \u2013&nbsp;vast numbers of whom were not expecting to need funding this year and thus did not have the documents required to get it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these decisions, however, could now be limiting your company\u2019s opportunities for growth, which is why we want to ensure that business owners understand their options. Here, we decipher the jargon and scotch some common misconceptions around the government\u2019s coronavirus recovery schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Definitions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is BBLS?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) is a new initiative that is 100% guaranteed by the government. It was introduced to support smaller, early-stage businesses that have been adversely affected by Covid-19.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eligible businesses can borrow 25% of their annual turnover, up to a maximum amount of \u00a350,000. Numerous lenders will accept self-certification via online applications, so many businesses can receive the funding within a matter of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan is another new initiative, which is 80% guaranteed by the government. It was created to support companies that need more financial support, but which have a turnover of less than \u00a345m and fewer than 250 employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eligible businesses can borrow up to \u00a35m, in the form of term debt, invoice finance, asset finance and revolving credit facilities. Although the application process takes slightly longer, firms can receive the funds in as little as a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is CLBILS?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) is aimed at companies that are too big to satisfy the turnover and employee criteria for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan. This initiative \u2013 also 80% guaranteed by the government \u2013&nbsp;permits eligible businesses to borrow up to \u00a3200m in term loans and up to \u00a350m in invoice finance and revolving credit facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these schemes was designed to help companies with cash flow and to enable firms to continue trading amid the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not as \u2018quick and easy\u2019 as it sounds<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiatives may sound attractive, but the reality is that many companies have not capitalised on the specific scheme that was designed with their type of business in mind, unwittingly limiting their opportunities for future growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the schemes were launched in April, many lenders were able to turn around BBLS applications quickly, because companies could self-certify via online questionnaires. However, the same lenders struggled to process Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan applications, which are often more complex and require a more tailored approach&nbsp;\u2013 and the firms themselves often did not have the information required, because they were not expecting to need it before Covid-19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Numerous rejected Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan applicants and businesses taking up BBLS loans as their first option, despite the fact that the BBLS scheme is aimed at micro-SMEs, rather than larger, more established SMEs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using the wrong scheme will not pay off<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) has covered some companies\u2019 short-term cash needs, it has a much smaller debt quantum than the other schemes \u2013&nbsp;and \u00a350,000 is often insufficient for long-term business recovery. In addition, BBLS is only available in the form of term loans, which does not offer the flexibility that some firms need during a crisis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe businesses that take a long-term view are the ones that will succeed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d says BOOST&amp;Co\u2019s Bristol-based principal Sinead Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that business owners have opted for the \u2018quick and easy\u2019 option, especially when we\u2019ve heard about the lack of success they have had at the hands of traditional lenders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut Covid-19 doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere, any time soon. Established SMEs should not feel restricted by the \u00a350,000 cap on BBLS loans; instead, they should think about how they can make use of larger facilities under Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan and CLBILS to invest in growth and future business development.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan offer that BBLS does not?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan and CLBILS loans are far larger than the quantum that is on offer under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, with loans of up to \u00a35m available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTaking on large amounts of debt during a crisis may seem counterintuitive, but firms need to ask themselves where their business is going,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThe innovative ones will be looking at new openings in the market and how they can embrace the rapid digitalisation of the past few months. They may even be seeking out opportunities to expand their business network through mergers and acquisitions. But they can\u2019t do any of this without funding.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different lenders will have different criteria, but Prudent Financial Corporation\u2019s experience of working with innovative, fast-growing SMEs means that it understands the need for tailored and flexible funding, crisis or no crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By offering <a href=\"https:\/\/pfc-group.org\/cbils\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"three Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan products (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">three Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan products<\/a>&nbsp;(term loans, invoice finance and revolving credit facilities), Prudent Financial Corporation enables businesses to access the type of funding that they need \u2013 and the fact that it can be used for mergers and acquisitions, for investment in future growth and to refinance existing loans makes the lender\u2019s products much more flexible than other recovery loans in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur ultimate aim is to ensure that the businesses that were growing before the pandemic continue to grow and develop in the coming months and years. We understand that business owners want fast and flexible funding, so we want to make that happen,\u201d Johnson says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Next steps for innovative businesses:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve taken out a BBLS loan but need more funding and meet the <a href=\"https:\/\/pfc-group.org\/cbils\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"criteria (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">criteria<\/a>, Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan is a valid option, with the first year\u2019s fees covered by the government. This scheme is open for applications until 30 September 2020.<br>You cannot take out loans with both schemes, but Prudent Financial Corporation can refinance existing BBLS loans \u2013&nbsp;or even smaller Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan loans, where we can generate additional funding to satisfy your working-capital needs. There is no penalty for doing so and we manage the repayment process with you.<br>If you&#8217;ve been rejected by your bank or another lender, you can apply again \u2013&nbsp;and you may well fit another lender\u2019s criteria. We are experts at working with growing SMEs and usually lend much earlier in a company\u2019s life cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To find out more and apply, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/pfc-group.org\/cbils\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">website<\/a><\/li><li>Read further information from the <a aria-label=\"World Business Bank (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.british-business-bank.co.uk\/ourpartners\/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">World Business Bank<\/a><\/li><li>Get in touch with Sinead via <a aria-label=\"email (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"sinead@boostandco.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">email<\/a> or on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sineadfjohnson\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why snap decisions made at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis should not define your company\u2019s future growth \u201cI would like a bounce-back, business interruption, coronavirus \u2013 but not Covid-19 \u2013 small, large, medium business loan with two facilities, please.\u201d If this sentiment sounds familiar, rest assured that you are not alone.
