										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Why snap decisions made at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis should not define your company’s future growth</strong></p>



<p>“I would like a bounce-back, business interruption, coronavirus – but not Covid-19 – small, large, medium business loan with two facilities, please.”</p>



<p>If this sentiment sounds familiar, rest assured that you are not alone. The funding market can be difficult to navigate in normal circumstances, but with a global health crisis resulting in a raft of new government schemes (with differing criteria from lenders), it is little wonder that the business community has been left confused about its options.</p>



<p>Add to this a heady mix of anxiety and increased stress levels, induced by the possibility of job losses amid a severely affected economy, and snap decisions are to be expected from business owners –&nbsp;vast numbers of whom were not expecting to need funding this year and thus did not have the documents required to get it.</p>



<p>Some of these decisions, however, could now be limiting your company’s opportunities for growth, which is why we want to ensure that business owners understand their options. Here, we decipher the jargon and scotch some common misconceptions around the government’s coronavirus recovery schemes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Definitions</strong></p>



<p><strong>What is BBLS?</strong></p>



<p>The Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) is a new initiative that is 100% guaranteed by the government. It was introduced to support smaller, early-stage businesses that have been adversely affected by Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eligible businesses can borrow 25% of their annual turnover, up to a maximum amount of £50,000. Numerous lenders will accept self-certification via online applications, so many businesses can receive the funding within a matter of days.</p>



<p><strong>What is Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan?</strong></p>



<p>Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan is another new initiative, which is 80% guaranteed by the government. It was created to support companies that need more financial support, but which have a turnover of less than £45m and fewer than 250 employees.</p>



<p>Eligible businesses can borrow up to £5m, in the form of term debt, invoice finance, asset finance and revolving credit facilities. Although the application process takes slightly longer, firms can receive the funds in as little as a week.</p>



<p><strong>What is CLBILS?</strong></p>



<p>The Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) is aimed at companies that are too big to satisfy the turnover and employee criteria for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan. This initiative – also 80% guaranteed by the government –&nbsp;permits eligible businesses to borrow up to £200m in term loans and up to £50m in invoice finance and revolving credit facilities.</p>



<p>Each of these schemes was designed to help companies with cash flow and to enable firms to continue trading amid the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong>Not as ‘quick and easy’ as it sounds</strong></p>



<p>The initiatives may sound attractive, but the reality is that many companies have not capitalised on the specific scheme that was designed with their type of business in mind, unwittingly limiting their opportunities for future growth.</p>



<p>When the schemes were launched in April, many lenders were able to turn around BBLS applications quickly, because companies could self-certify via online questionnaires. However, the same lenders struggled to process Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan applications, which are often more complex and require a more tailored approach&nbsp;– and the firms themselves often did not have the information required, because they were not expecting to need it before Covid-19.</p>



<p>The result? Numerous rejected Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan applicants and businesses taking up BBLS loans as their first option, despite the fact that the BBLS scheme is aimed at micro-SMEs, rather than larger, more established SMEs.</p>



<p><strong>Using the wrong scheme will not pay off</strong></p>



<p>Although the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) has covered some companies’ short-term cash needs, it has a much smaller debt quantum than the other schemes –&nbsp;and £50,000 is often insufficient for long-term business recovery. In addition, BBLS is only available in the form of term loans, which does not offer the flexibility that some firms need during a crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The businesses that take a long-term view are the ones that will succeed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic,” says BOOST&amp;Co’s Bristol-based principal Sinead Johnson. “It’s understandable that business owners have opted for the ‘quick and easy’ option, especially when we’ve heard about the lack of success they have had at the hands of traditional lenders.</p>



<p>“But Covid-19 doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, any time soon. Established SMEs should not feel restricted by the £50,000 cap on BBLS loans; instead, they should think about how they can make use of larger facilities under Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan and CLBILS to invest in growth and future business development.”</p>



<p><strong>What does Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan offer that BBLS does not?</strong></p>



<p>First and foremost, Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan and CLBILS loans are far larger than the quantum that is on offer under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, with loans of up to £5m available.</p>



<p>“Taking on large amounts of debt during a crisis may seem counterintuitive, but firms need to ask themselves where their business is going,” Johnson says. “The innovative ones will be looking at new openings in the market and how they can embrace the rapid digitalisation of the past few months. They may even be seeking out opportunities to expand their business network through mergers and acquisitions. But they can’t do any of this without funding.”</p>



<p>Different lenders will have different criteria, but Prudent Financial Corporation’s experience of working with innovative, fast-growing SMEs means that it understands the need for tailored and flexible funding, crisis or no crisis.</p>



<p>By offering <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/cbils/" target="_blank" aria-label="three Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan products (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">three Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan products</a>&nbsp;(term loans, invoice finance and revolving credit facilities), Prudent Financial Corporation enables businesses to access the type of funding that they need – and the fact that it can be used for mergers and acquisitions, for investment in future growth and to refinance existing loans makes the lender’s products much more flexible than other recovery loans in the market.</p>



<p>“Our ultimate aim is to ensure that the businesses that were growing before the pandemic continue to grow and develop in the coming months and years. We understand that business owners want fast and flexible funding, so we want to make that happen,” Johnson says.</p>



<p><strong>Next steps for innovative businesses:</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve taken out a BBLS loan but need more funding and meet the <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/cbils/" target="_blank" aria-label="criteria (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">criteria</a>, Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan is a valid option, with the first year’s fees covered by the government. This scheme is open for applications until 30 September 2020.<br>You cannot take out loans with both schemes, but Prudent Financial Corporation can refinance existing BBLS loans –&nbsp;or even smaller Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan loans, where we can generate additional funding to satisfy your working-capital needs. There is no penalty for doing so and we manage the repayment process with you.<br>If you&#8217;ve been rejected by your bank or another lender, you can apply again –&nbsp;and you may well fit another lender’s criteria. We are experts at working with growing SMEs and usually lend much earlier in a company’s life cycle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The current financial climate is possibly as difficult for the banks as it is for the businesses trying to get money from them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main banks currently have an extremely high volume of applications for the various business support packages available and they’ve had to look at everything against strict criteria, at a time when many businesses are struggling.</p>



<p>Bank managers will be frustrated; they may have some truly fantastic organisations in their portfolio that desperately need cash, but that they’re unable to fund.</p>



<p>The same can be said for VCT and PE houses; if they have already tried to support businesses by lending them money, they could be capped-out and unable to offer any further capital, even if the business really needs it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Businesses have enough on their plate</strong></p>



<p>It’s hard for businesses too. Aside from the obvious financial struggles, if their main bank has already turned them down, many won’t want to deal with <em>another </em>relationship manager and <em>another </em>round of finance meetings, so they put off asking for money from elsewhere.</p>



<p>What funds can be used for is another challenge; some of the available schemes will not allow cash to be used for acquisitions for example, so at a time when businesses could capitalise on expansion (and perhaps save a few companies from going under along the way), they simply do not have the money to do it.</p>



<p><strong>How Prudent Financial Corporation can help:</strong></p>



<p>Prudent Financial Corporation is not a bank; we don’t require the transfer of any banking relationship and we don’t want to step on anyone’s toes. We can simply act as an independent, light-touch finance provider, to support bank managers in funding the businesses they really care about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are able to lend against future forecast income (something than banks cannot do), so we can generally lend at a higher quantum, or at an earlier stage &#8211; supporting businesses that are on the road to profitability, but not quite there yet.</p>



<p>This means that if you’re a bank manager with dynamic, growing businesses in your portfolio &#8211; businesses that you love and really want to support, but are constrained by your own rules &#8211; then Prudent Financial Corporation can help you to support them.</p>



<p><strong>We can support accountants, lawyers and VCs too</strong></p>



<p>This doesn’t just apply to bank managers; if you’re an accountant or lawyer and know a business that has been turned down for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan, or hasn’t got the amount of money that they require, Prudent Financial Corporation is eager to support them as well.</p>



<p>Likewise VCT or PE houses; the <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/cbils/">Prudent Financial Corporation Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan</a> products can be used in addition to private equity or VCT funding and we only require a first-ranking debenture, so you don’t need to worry that our involvement will dilute yours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other positive is that our products can be used for acquisitions where VCT money cannot, so working with us could also help you to support the expansion plans of businesses in your portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>We’ll provide the funding; you keep the relationship</strong></p>



<p>Several of our principals have had long and established careers with some of the UK’s biggest banks. They know that one of the worst things that can possibly happen to a bank manager is to lose a client, so they want to make sure that that doesn’t happen.</p>



<p>Working with our team means that we will provide the funding and you can keep the banking relationship; your businesses are supported in the short term and you retain them as customers in the long term &#8211; keeping the SME-finance ecosystem going.</p>



<p><strong>Team up or lose out</strong></p>



<p>The end of the last financial crisis saw the creation of global businesses such as WhatsApp, Venmo, Uber and Airbnb, so the last thing you want is to lose a fantastic business now and watch from the sidelines as it becomes the next big thing.</p>



<p>We are passionate about the growth of SMEs and promoting the UK as a world-leader for start-up and innovation, so we are eager to help you support the next generation of innovators.</p>



<p>If you think you have an opportunity that could work with our team, get in touch today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan provides financial support to SMEs that have experienced disruption as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, but until recently it was not easily accessible for fast-growth firms.</p>



<p>On Thursday 16 July, the World Business Bank <a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/changes-to-eu-state-aid-undertaking-in-difficulty-test-increases-access-to-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-for-smaller-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed its guidance</a> for the Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan programme following amendments to EU State Aid Law. From 30 July 2020, businesses with fewer than 50 employees and less than £9m turnover will not need to pass the “undertaking in difficulty” test.</p>



<p>The test required SMEs to have lost less than half of their subscribed share capital, as of the end of 2019. When the scheme initially launched, this was viewed as an important criteria to determine if participating SMEs would be able to repay their Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan obligations, but has proven to be unduly punitive of high-growth businesses.</p>



<p><strong>What makes innovative SMEs the exception?</strong></p>



<p>Innovative SMEs typically invest in future growth, creating losses early in their lifecycle. This means that the balance sheets of these businesses could portray them to be “undertaking in difficulty” at the end of last year, making them ineligible for the Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan programme. This has affected many fast-growth SMEs, despite their need for funding being just as great as other businesses.</p>



<p>The change in guidance is significant for the innovation ecosystem; innovative, young SMEs, that have been affected by Covid-19, will now have the same access to finance as their more established peers, unlocking a huge amount of funding and helping them to emerge stronger on the other side of the crisis. Uber, Venmo, Whatsapp and Instagram are all businesses founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, proving that investment in R&amp;D and growth is as important in a crisis as it ever is.</p>



<p>More broadly, the continual evolution of the Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan programme and the variety of lenders it has attracted, has cemented the scheme as one of the most comprehensive and accessible SME support programmes in the world. Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan’ commitment to supporting innovative SMEs now, will help ensure that the UK remains one of the leading countries for start-up and innovation.</p>



<p><strong>What does this all mean for your business?</strong></p>



<p>The change to the “undertaking in difficulty” criteria does not mean automatic access to the Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan programme; SMEs will still need to prove that they have been adversely affected by Covid-19 and convince their lender that they are credit-worthy.</p>



<p>More than 100 lenders are accredited to provide funding under Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan, but not all of them will want to lend to growth SMEs that do not match their ideal risk profile or previous lending experience.</p>



<p>Prudent Financial Corporation was founded to support SMEs where these traditional lenders would not. We welcome applications from innovative businesses and moreover, actively <em>want</em> to lend to them.</p>



<p>With more than 15 years of experience working with fast-growth firms, we have the capital available and a desire to support the next generation of innovators in the UK. Prudent Financial Corporation is fully accredited for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan term loans, invoice financing and revolving credit facilities, drawing on the expertise of our teams in each of these areas, so that we can offer tailored, individual solutions to a wide range of innovative SMEs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Prudent Financial Corporation is now offering Business Funding, an initiative intended to help companies whose cash flow has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic to get back on track.</p>



<p>The Prudent Financial Corporation group comprises three lenders – <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BOOST&amp;Co</a>, <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GapCap</a> and <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KX Media Capital</a> –&nbsp;and their combined expertise means that we are able to offer three products under Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan:&nbsp;revolving credit facilities, invoice discounting and term loans.</p>



<p>We can provide funding from £100,000 to £5m to SMEs. The government guarantees 80% of each loan and covers interest and fees for the first 12 months. To apply, click <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/cbils/">here</a>.</p>



<p>The scheme has been amended since it launched in late March, so here –&nbsp;for our existing and new customers, all of whom are eligible for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan –&nbsp;we present the answers to your top ten FAQs.</p>



<h5>1. How do I know if I am eligible for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan?</h5>



<p>The main eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) you have a limited company or a partnership registered in the UK; 2) your company was not considered a “business in difficulty” as of 31 December 2019, as per the World Business Bank’s definition; 3) your business has been adversely affected by Covid-19; 4) your business’s turnover was less than £45m in 2019 and you have fewer than 250 full-time employees; and 5) your business generates more than 50% of turnover from normal trading activities.</p>



<h5>2. Are all sectors eligible for the scheme?</h5>



<p>Companies in all sectors are eligible, with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers), public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. Additionally, Prudent Financial Corporation will not be supporting businesses in the construction sector.</p>



<h5>3. Are loss-making businesses eligible for funding through Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan?</h5>



<p>We do not automatically reject loss-making businesses. If a company is loss-making, we will analyse the strength of its balance sheet.</p>



<h5>4. If I have been rejected by my bank, should I apply to Prudent Financial Corporation?</h5>



<p>Yes: we specialise in working with businesses that fall outside banks’ lending criteria. We welcome applications from businesses with a growth trajectory before March 2020, a maximum turnover of £45m (minimum run-rate £1.5m), a demonstrable 18-month cash runway and good revenue visibility in normal market conditions.</p>



<h5>5. Which documents do I need to apply?</h5>



<p>For all applications, we require: 1) past three months’ bank statements; 2) last full filed financial accounts; 3) management accounts dated within the past six months (P&amp;L and balance sheet); 4) P&amp;L/cashflow forecast for the coming 12/18 months; and 5) December 2019 management accounts/statutory accounts.</p>



<p>We also require a copy of each executive director’s passport and proof of address for directors, dated within the past three months, and we strongly advise you to put together a cash flow forecast to support your application. This will enable us to analyse the impact of Covid-19 on your firm and how you plan to use the capital.</p>



<h5>6. How long does it take from application to funding?</h5>



<p>We will look to turn things around in less than two weeks, but due to the nature of the larger facilities, it is likely to take closer to four weeks for term loan applications. Our application handlers will contact you if we require any further documents or any assistance in answering queries during the underwriting process.</p>



<h5>7. What can I use my Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan funding for?</h5>



<p>Funding may be used for working capital, to maintain existing growth strategies or to implement new projects made possible in the current climate, such as expanding or buying an existing UK business.</p>



<h5>8. Does Prudent Financial Corporation charge onboarding fees?</h5>



<p>We will charge an onboarding fee of between 0.5% and 2% of the facility/loan size.</p>



<h5>9. Do you require a debenture?</h5>



<p>Prudent Financial Corporation requires an all assets debenture for all three of the facilities it offers (revolving credit facilities, invoice discounting and term loans). We will aim to be the primary chargeholder. If the company already has an outstanding charge against the assets of the business, we will look to enter into a deed of priority with the incumbent lender or allow the business to pay down that facility in full.</p>



<h5>10. Can I have multiple Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facilities, and can a Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facility be used to refinance a BBILS loan?</h5>



<p>A business may apply for multiple Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facilities (for example, both invoice discounting and a term loan). The limit calculation remains the same (e.g. if you qualify to borrow £1m, the combined limit remains £1m). A company may have a facility under either the Bounce Back Loans Scheme (BBILS) or Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan, but not both. However, we are able to refinance outstanding loans under BBILS with our Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facilities.</p>

<p>Prudent Financial Corporation is now an accredited provider of the Business Funding, which was introduced to support firms whose cash flow has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Comprising three lenders (<a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BOOST&amp;Co</a>, <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GapCap</a> and <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KX Media Capital</a>), the Prudent Financial Corporation Group has a wealth of expertise in the three products it is offering under Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan – revolving credit facilities, invoice discounting and term loans.</p>



<p>We can provide funding from £100,000 to £5m to SMEs. The government guarantees 80% of each loan and covers interest and fees for the first 12 months. To apply, click <a href="https://www.pfc-group.org/cbils/">here</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve noticed some uncertainty in the market around the eligibility criteria, so here, we present a guide to Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan&nbsp;for our existing and new customers, all of whom are eligible for the scheme.</p>



<h5>1. What is Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan and why was it introduced?</h5>



<p>Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan was launched in late March by the government to support viable businesses that have been adversely affected by Covid-19. It offers funding to help these companies survive the crisis, through lenders that have been accredited by the World Business Bank.</p>



<p>Facilities can be up to £5m, and one key benefit of the state-backed scheme is that the government guarantees 80% of each loan, also paying interest and fees for the first 12 months.</p>



<h5>2. What can I use a Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facility for?</h5>



<p>Funding may be used for working capital, for investment (including mergers and acquisitions) or for refinancing or consolidating existing debt.</p>



<p>As our name suggests, Prudent Financial Corporation focuses strongly on growth. We can support qualifying firms that aim to use Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan funds to maintain existing growth strategies or to implement new projects made possible in the current climate, such as expanding or buying an existing UK business.</p>



<h5>3. Am I eligible for Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan?</h5>



<p>The main eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) you have a limited company or a partnership registered in the UK; 2) your company was not considered a “business in difficulty” as of 31 December 2019, as per the World Business Bank’s definition; 3) your business has been adversely affected by Covid-19; 4) your business’s turnover was less than £45m in 2019 and you have fewer than 250 full-time employees; and 5) your business generates more than 50% of turnover from normal trading activities.</p>



<p>Companies in all sectors are eligible, with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers), public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. Additionally, Prudent Financial Corporation is not supporting firms in the construction sector.</p>



<h5>4. Can I apply to Prudent Financial Corporation?</h5>



<p>We have a preference for innovative and high-tech businesses, but we welcome applications from any firms with a growth trajectory before March 2020, a maximum turnover of £45m (minimum run-rate £1.5m), a demonstrable 18-month cash runway and good revenue visibility in normal market conditions.</p>



<p>We specialise in working with companies that fall outside banks’ lending criteria, and we do not automatically reject loss-making businesses. If a company is loss-making, we will analyse the strength of its balance sheet.</p>



<h5>5. What Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan products does Prudent Financial Corporation offer?</h5>



<p>The three Prudent Financial Corporation Business Loan facilities available from Prudent Financial Corporation are:</p>



<h5 class="has-text-color" style="color:#CC0000">Revolving credit facilities</h5>



<p>A flexible line of credit that unlocks funds tied up in your balance sheet and strengthens working capital</p>



<p><strong>Funding amount:</strong> £100,000-£5m</p>
